# Contributing to Prison Guard Simulator

Thank you for considering contributing to Prison Guard Simulator! Before you start, please read through the following guidelines to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## Godot Engine Version

Make sure to use Godot Engine v4.2.1.stable for development.

## Coding Standards

### Variables

- Variable names should be in camelCase, e.g., `variableName`.
- Whenever possible, provide a type for variables.

### Functions

- Function names should be in snake_case, e.g., `function_name`.
- Arguments in functions should be typed, if possible.

### Node Nesting

Avoid nesting "CanvasGroup" nodes to prevent drawing issues, especially on the compatibility renderer.

## Autoload Scripts

If you modify the autoload scripts (`res://Scripts/globalVariables.gd` and `res://Scripts/globalFunctions.gd`), please provide a clear explanation of why the modifications were necessary.
